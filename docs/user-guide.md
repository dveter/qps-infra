# User Guide (Draft)

## How to use these features? 
To start there are a number of additional parameters that can be added to an existing Test Suite xml.
These parameters are: 
</br>
<b> jenkinsJobName </b> - This property is just the name that Jenkins should create a job for, the normal pattern here is to include the platform name in the job itself to make it easier to find inside of Jenkins. 
</br>
<b>jenkinsJobType </b> – This property tells Jenkins what type of job it is. This field can take a “web” or “api” value.
If value set to “api” – Jenkins knows that there is no need to use web browser for run this Test Suite.
If value set to “web” – Jenkins will use web browser to run the Test. Chrome browser will be used by default.
</br>
<b> jenkinsEmail </b> - This property takes a comma separated list of emails/distribution lists that end results of a Test Suite will be emailed to. 
</br>
<b> jenkinsFailedEmail </b> - This property takes a comma separated list of emails/distribution lists that end results of a Test Suite that contains failures will be emailed to. 
</br>
<b>jenkinsRegressionPipeline </b> - This property takes a comma separated string of the various pipelines that a specific Test Suite will be attached to. (i.e. nightly_regression_cron, full_regression_cron). This would end up creating two pipeline jobs inside of Jenkins. 
</br>
<b>jenkinsEnvironments </b> - This property takes a comma separated string of the various environments that will be tested for that particular suite. (i.e. PROD, QA,DEV,STAGE,BETA, etc...) 
</br>
<b> jenkinsPipelineEnvironments </b> - This property takes a comma separated string of the various environments that will be tested for a particular suite in a particular pipeline (i.e. PROD,QA,DEV,STAGE) 
</br>
<b>jenkinsJobExecutionOrder</b> - This property takes a number value and allows for a pipeline to be generated which will run tests in a sequential synchronous manner, compared to the default asynchronous manner. 
</br>
<b> jenkinsJobExecutionMode </b> -This property is only consumed when a jenkinsJobExecutionOrder has been set on a pipeline which would put that pipeline into a synchronous mode and takes a value of "continue". 
When that is specified if a prior job has had an error while running the next job in sequence will still pick up and run instead of halting the entire pipeline. 
</br>
<b> jenkinsRegressionMatrix </b> - This property we use for creating configuration test matrix. 
</br>
<b> overrideFields </b> - This property takes any number of custom fields that need to be available at run-time for a job to run successfully.


## Test Jobs (API/Web/Mobile)
Jenkins Pipeline Job - this is a job that can be created for each suite and can be executed on demand or by schedule. 

### Create a Job

* Open TestNG suite xml file
* Fill the bunch of necessary parameters in your xml:
```
<parameter name="suiteOwner" value="qpsdemo"/>
<parameter name="jenkinsJobName" value="Job1"/>
<parameter name="jenkinsJobType" value="api"/>
<parameter name="jenkinsEmail" value="test@qaprosoft.com"/>
<parameter name="jenkinsEnvironments" value="DEMO"/> 
```
* Commit and merge.
* You will see "Job1" Job after Scan is finished (automatic or manual). 

### Run a Job
Steps:

* Login to Jenkins
* Go to organization/repository and open a Job
* Click Build with Parameters and run Build 
* When Job is Completed analyze published reports/logs (Carina reports/Zafira reports/TestNG reports)

### Schedule a Job
* Open TestNG suite xml file
* Fill the bunch of necessary parameters in your xml if they are absent:
```
<parameter name="scheduling" value="H 2 * * *" /> 
```
> Note: As a value provide regular Jenkins Cron expression.To prganize multiple schedules use "\n" as separator:
```
<parameter name="scheduling" value="H 2 * * *\nH 10 * * *" /> 
```
* Commit and merge.

### Delete a Job

* Delete TestNG suite xml file
* Commit and merge.
* Ask your administrator to remove the Job on Jenkins.

## Cron Jobs(Layer of testing)
Jenkins Pipeline Cron - this is a job that can include different suites/jobs and can be executed on demand or by schedule.

### Create a Cron
* Open each TestNG suite xml file(s) 
* Declare "jenkinsRegressionPipeline" property in xml:
```
<parameter name="jenkinsRegressionPipeline" value="nightly_regression, full_regression"/>
```
* Commit and merge.
* After Scan is finished (automatic or manual) nightly_regression, full_regression crons are created in Jenkins.

#### How to Set up Configuration Matrix
* Open TestNG suite xml file 
* Declare "jenkinsRegressionMatrix" property in xml:
```
<parameter name="jenkinsRegressionPipeline" value="Carina-Demo-Regression-Pipeline"/>
<parameter name="jenkinsRegressionMatrix" value="env: DEMO, branch: master; env:PROD, branch: prod"/>
```
* Commit and merge.
* After Scan is finished (automatic or manual) Carina-Demo-Regression-Pipeline cron job is created in Jenkins.
* Every time you run Carina-Demo-Regression-Pipeline job it should start your suite xml child job twice for DEMO and PROD environments using appropriate branches.
> Note: Any param values pairs can be provided. Comma separated - for single job params. Semicolon separated for multiple child job params.

### Run a Cron
Steps:

* Go to organization/repository and open a Cron Job
> Note: There is a "CRON" view for such kind of jobs
* Click Build with Parameters and run Build 
* Cron Job should trigger children jobs according to desired configuration matrix
* When Cron Job is Completed analyze children jobs' reports/logs (Carina reports/Zafira reports/TestNG reports)

### Schedule a Cron
* Open any child TestNG suite xml file 
* Declare "jenkinsRegressionScheduling" parameter :
```
<parameter name="jenkinsRegressionPipeline" value="Carina-Demo-Regression-Pipeline"/>
<parameter name="jenkinsRegressionScheduling" value="H 2 * * *" /> 
```
* Commit and merge.
* After Scan is finished (automatic or manual) Carina-Demo-Regression-Pipeline is created and sheduled to run periodically in Jenkins.

### Delete a Cron

* Open each TestNG suite xml file(s) and remove declaration of "jenkinsRegressionPipeline" property.
* Commit and merge.
* Ask your administrator to delete Cron job in Jenkins
