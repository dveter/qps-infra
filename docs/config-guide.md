## Source Control Tools Integration
  For enterprise github or gitlab, you can declare the following global variables in Jenkins and the entire infrastructure    will use them immediately by default:
 <ul>
   <li>  Manage jenkins -> Configure system 
   <li>  Global properties -> Add property 
       <ul>
       <li> GITHUB_API_URL -> https://$GITHUB_HOST/api/v3 
       <li> GITHUB_HOST -> github.mydomain.com 
       <li> GITHUB_HTML_URL -> https://$GITHUB_HOST/$GITHUB_ORGANIZATION 
       <li> GITHUB_ORGANIZATION -> myorganization 
       <li> GITHUB_SSH_URL -> git@$GITHUB_HOST:$GITHUB_ORGANIZATION 
       </ul>   
 </ul>

  *  Go to Manage Jenkins -> Configure System
  *  Specify a value for GitHub Server API URL, for example, https://api.github.com
> Note: corporate versions of GitHub should have a different value, for example, https://github.mydomain.com/api/v3
  *  Provide GitHub credentials with Admin privileges for your organization
  *  Check the "Auto-manage webhooks" param
     * [Optional] update "Commit Status Context" to a value such as qps-infra to identify that changes in GitHub PR are automatically generated by infra
  *  Save changes
> Note: be sure to test integration through the Jenkins UI

#### Test the integration with Github through the Jenkins UI
   *  Set Credentials -> Test basic connection to GitHub
   *  Set Repository owner/name -> Test Permissions to a Repository
   *  Set Issue ID/Comment -> Test adding comment to Pull Request
